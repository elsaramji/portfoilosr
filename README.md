- **Presentation Layer** – Flutter widgets and screens using **Riverpod** or **Bloc** for state management.
- **Domain Layer** – Business logic, entities, and use cases with pure Dart.
- **Data Layer** – Integration with **Firestore** and remote/local data sources.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

This project follows a **TDD-first approach**, aiming for high reliability and confidence in refactoring:

- ✅ **Unit tests** for core logic and use cases.
- 🧩 **Widget tests** for UI components.
- 🔄 **Mocking** for Firestore and external APIs.
- 📈 Goal: **100% test coverage** for all business-critical logic.
